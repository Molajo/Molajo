I. INTRODUCTION

1. What is a Layout?
A Layout is a set of files used to display and format the data generated by a Menu Item View.

2. What is a View?
A View is put into action by a Menu Item. It interacts with a database Model to retrieve state and rowset information required to produce a Layout.

3. What is a rowset?
A rowset is the collection of item information produced by a database Model at the request of a View. The View processes each item in the rowset, one at a time, and invokes the specific layout file needed to display the information.

4. What is a row?
A row is set of data called columns that a layout can use to display information about a single item. The Layout can access the row using the $this->row construct.

5. What is a column?
A column is a single piece of information about an item. The Layout can display column values by specifying the column name for the row, as follows:

<? echo $this->row->column; ?>

3. Where are Layouts located?

Layouts can also be a folder in the component/view/tmpl folder, or within the modules/
Layouts can also be located in the templates/html/layouts folder.

III. WORKING WITH QUERY RESULTS IN LAYOUTS

1. How are the layout files processed by Molajo?
There are two options for using query results:
A. To process the recordset within your layout file, include the custom.php layout file, but no other layout files.
B. To allow Molajo to handle recordset process, the body.php file must be available.

2. How does the Molajo View process the recordset and render the layout files?
The Molajo View loops through each row, one at a time.
The following layoutFolder/layouts/ files are included, if existing.

A. Before any rows and if there is a top.php file:
    * beforeDisplayContent output is rendered;
    * the top.php file is included.

B. Each row is processed one at a time, as follows:
    * if there is a header.php file, it is included and event afterDisplayTitle output is rendered.
    * if there is a body.php file, it is included.
    * if there is a footer.php file, it is included.

C. After all rows have been processed, and if there is a footer.php file:
    * the footer.php file is included;
    * afterDisplayContent output is rendered;

2. What columns are available in the row for the layout?
To display the columns available for each row, set Show Column Information to true in the Menu Item parameters,
    or if you are rendering a layout in the Administrator, use the Component Options.
    Once the parameter has been saved, refresh the page. The system information will be displayed on the page.

$date	= JHtml::_('date', $this->row->created, JText::_('DATE_FORMAT_LC1'));
$time	= JHtml::_('date', $this->row->checked_out_time, 'H:i');

Options:
DATE_FORMAT_LC="l, d F Y"
